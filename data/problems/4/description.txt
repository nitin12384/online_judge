The organizers of the children's holiday are planning to inflate  m balloons for it. 
They invited n assistants, the i-th assistant inflates a balloon in  t[i]  minutes, 
but every time after z[i] balloons are inflated he gets tired and rests for y[i] minutes. 

Now the organizers of the holiday want to know after what time all the balloons will be inflated 
with the most optimal work of the assistants (minimal overall time), and how many balloons each of them will inflate. 


(If the assistant has inflated the balloon and needs to rest, but he will not have to inflate more balloons, 
then it is considered that he finished the work immediately after the end of the last balloon inflation, and not after the rest).
