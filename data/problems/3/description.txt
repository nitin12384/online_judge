Naruto had a Balanced Bracket Sequence of length n (Sequence is represented as a String).

A Balanced bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example:

-> Bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are Balanced (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)");
-> Bracket sequences ")(", "(" and ")" are not. 

Unfortunately, Obito got his hands on Naruto's string and "deformed" it by replacing some (possible zero or all) of characers with '?'.

Now, Naruto has given you the task to create a Balanced Bracket Sequence by replacing the '?' with either "(" or ")"

It is guranteed that there is always at least one way to form a Balanced Bracket Sequence from given deformed sequence.

Find the no. of distinct ways to form a Balanced Bracket Sequence from given deformed sequence.
Since output could be very large, output it modulo 1000000007 .

Note : two ways are considered distinct, if there's at least one position for which one sequence has a differnt character than the other.
